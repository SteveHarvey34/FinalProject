# FinalProject
I tried to make a tower defence game, nothing went well because of the enemy, i spent all my time trying to code the ai control to move to a waypoint that i set up but it never worked out, I learned that I need to spend more time developping the game mechanics rather tahn focusing on onecode
2. The enemy wouldn't move to the points I gave it because i didnt have a component that the code could find within the code
3. I would Start on finishing the basics of the game and worry about the enemy movement at the end.
